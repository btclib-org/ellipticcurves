"""What `tests/_data/README.md` must not say about itself.

The same claim `release_notes_test.py` forbids CHANGELOG.md, for the same
reason and one more. A stated count is a line every open branch has to
edit, so a pull request vendoring a vector file is guaranteed to conflict
on it -- measured: the summary read 46, 47, 48, 49 and 50 across the
branches open on one afternoon, and each of those numbers was a rebase
conflict for the others. Worse, two branches moving it to the *same* new
number merge with nothing to decide, into a number that is wrong.

The one more is that this file has no `merge=union` driver to fall back
on, and cannot have one: union keeps both sides' added lines, which is
right for a list of bullets and nonsense for the prose around them. So
the number goes, the lists stay -- they are the fact the number
summarized -- and the Summary carries the `git ls-files` command that
derives it on demand.

Section 9 of the organization standard states the rule this module
enforces: never state how many of anything a file holds. Its one
exception is a count of what upstream published, which pins a vendored
file rather than measuring this tree. Everything below is an application
of that rule: a numeral -- a digit run, or a spelled-out numeral as a word -- is
forbidden anywhere in this README unless `_NOT_A_COUNT` accounts for it,
or the line it sits on is named in `_EXEMPT` with the reason beside it.

A shape match is not the guard: "N files." opening a line, and a bullet under
`## Summary` opening with a digit, each have a gap a widened pattern would only
move -- the noun ("response bodies", "vectors", a spelled-out "seven") and the
section (a `###` heading or the Provenance prose are not `## Summary`) -- and
the general form of "a count in prose" is not regular, so a pattern loose enough
to catch every wrong shape also catches sentences that are not wrong
(btclib-org/btclib#1633). What is enumerated instead is what is *permitted*:
every line below was found by running the pattern above against this file as it
stands and reading what it caught, not by predicting the shape a violation would
take.

The carve-outs are mechanical rather than semantic, and none of them scopes
the scan to a section:

- **A fenced block is not scanned, whatever its language.** The
  ` ```text ` ones are the pin metadata -- `repo`, `path`, `commit`,
  `blob`, `pulled`, `behind` -- which this README's own "Reading an
  entry" section already defines as facts of a pin, on every entry;
  scanning them would repeat that one justification once per entry for
  nothing a reader learns twice. The ` ```shell ` ones are commands, and
  a digit in a command is an argument.
- **"one" and "zero" are matched as digits, never as spelled words.** As
  words they are pronouns and articles ("one of them", "not one", "no
  one") far more often than counts in this file's prose, and a pattern
  that treated every "one" as a numeral would flag most of its sentences
  for no reason connected to this guard.
- **A numeral naming something is subtracted before `_NUMERAL` runs.**
  `_NOT_A_COUNT` takes out an ISO date, a `bip-`/`slip-` or NIST `P-` number, an
  `issue #N`, an `ISS N` or an `owner/repo#N`, a Wycheproof `tcId N` and a
  dotted version, each of which names a thing rather than counting one. A hyphen
  is what puts a specification number in front of the pattern at all: a digit
  run is matched between word boundaries, which `bip-0327` offers and a fused
  `BIP0327` does not, so such a number is caught or missed according to how
  upstream spells its own path. Exempting such a line records a decision nobody
  made, where an entry of `_EXEMPT` is meant to record one
  (btclib-org/btclib#1684).

An exemption pins its line verbatim, so editing a line that carries one
means editing its entry too. That cost is one line and not a paragraph:
nothing here rewraps markdown -- `markdownlint`'s MD013 has no fixer and
prettier's own hook does not take markdown -- so a correction is
surgical, and the guards below name the line they are unhappy about.

A test rather than a hook, for the reasons `docs_test.py` gives: no
environment the suite does not already have, every interpreter of the
matrix rather than one runner, and `tests-passed` gates it without a line
in any `needs` list.
