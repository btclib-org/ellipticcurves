"""Every decoder, on input nobody wrote down.

The rest of the suite is fixed vectors: exactly what conformance needs,
and blind to the malformed octets that never make it into a
specification's test section. This file is the converse. It does not
assert that a decoder accepts the right things -- the vectors do that --
but that it *fails the way the package says it fails*, whatever it is
handed: an IndexError off a short slice, an OverflowError off an
unchecked size or a silent short read reaches a caller who catches
`EllipticCurvesValueError` to reject bad input and has no reason to
expect anything else.

`fuzz/`'s atheris harnesses ask the same question of the signature and
envelope decoders for an hour a week; this asks it of every decoder on
every run, for as long as hypothesis spends on a test.
