"""The copyright holder is one name, and every source file says so.

Three places name the holder and each is static text a human edits:
LICENSE's copyright line, `pyproject.toml`'s `authors`, and the header
every Python file opens with. Nothing derives any of them from another,
so a change to one is silent everywhere else until something reads them
together, which is what this module does. `docs/source/conf.py` is the
fourth reader and derives its value instead, which the last test holds.

The header is read off this module's own first three lines rather than
off `COPYRIGHT`, where section 14 of the organization standard keeps its
text: `COPYRIGHT` is not in the sdist, and the suite runs from one. That
the two agree is section 14's own comparison, made from
`btclib-org/.github`.
