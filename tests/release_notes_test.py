"""What CHANGELOG.md and RELEASE_NOTES.md must not say about themselves.

A count of its own entries is the one fact in either file nothing
derives: prose can be reviewed, a number is right or wrong invisibly.
Checking the number against the entries would make it a line every open
branch has to edit, so neither file states one -- CHANGELOG.md's preamble
says so -- and this module fails on a count in either.

A test rather than a reading because `.gitattributes` marks both files
`merge=union`: the driver never conflicts, so a branch carrying a count
paragraph restores it on a rebase with nothing in the merge output to say
so.
