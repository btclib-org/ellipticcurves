"""The gate for what a public function's name promises about its answer.

CONTRIBUTING.md's "Every public function validates its inputs" states the
vocabulary: `assert_*` refuses and returns None, `is_*` and `verify*`
answer a bool about a value of a declared type, and `check_*` answers a
bool *and* refuses what cannot be an answer -- the one prefix that warns
a caller it still needs an `except`.

A prefix that says several things says nothing, which is what issue
btclib-org/btclib#814 found of `check_`, and a vocabulary kept as a habit
is one nothing notices drifting. So it is a rule here, read off the
annotations rather than off a list of names somebody keeps in step. What
it cannot see is the *contract*: that one `is_` is total over its values
and one `check_` is not is a promise in prose, and only the return type
is here.

There is no exemption list: every name carrying a prefix is held to it,
and every public bool carries one.
