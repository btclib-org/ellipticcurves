"""Every `bool` parameter of the package, classified and held to its class.

A `bool` parameter is a kind or a truth, and only the first is
type-checked, which is `musig2._flag`'s reasoning: a kind written down
and read back -- json, a configuration file, a coordinator's message --
arrives as whatever it was written as, and `"false"` is true. Issue
btclib-org/btclib#868 asked for the census this file is.

## The line

A **truth** only decides whether the call refuses: `verify=False` says
do not check the signature just computed, and the signature handed back
is the same one. So a value read for its truth runs a check or skips one
and changes no answer, which is why nothing is refused there.

A **kind** decides what a non-refusing call computes or returns. `"no"`
is true, so a kind read for its truth quietly computes the other answer
-- the other signature, the other encoding -- and that is what the
refusal is for.

## The polarity a truth has to have

`"no"` is true, and so is every other wrong value, so the misreading is
never "the flag was off": it is always the one the flag's `True` stands
for. That is what makes a truth safe rather than the fact that it changes
no answer -- `strict="no"` is strict, `order_check="no"` checks the
order. The wrong value falls on the side that refuses more.

So a truth's `True` has to be its conservative value, and a flag whose
`True` is the permissive one is a kind however little it computes.
`hybrid` is one, waiving the very refusal it was written to make, and it
is in `_KINDS` under a comment of its own; issue btclib-org/btclib#884 is
the one that asked.

The two tests below are that line, one each:

- a kind refuses `"no"`, `0`, `1` and (where the annotation does not
  declare it) `None`, with an `EllipticCurvesTypeError`
- a truth **accepts** them, on a fixture the flag's `True` accepts: a
  truth that starts refusing fails here, and the entry has to move
  rather than the test being edited

## The walk

`_bool_parameters` reads every public function of the package and every
`bool`-annotated parameter of one, so a flag added anywhere is either in
a table here or the run is red -- there is no third table, and that is
the state to keep.
