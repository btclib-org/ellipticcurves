"""Tests for what the package exports.

Every module and package of ellipticcurves declares an `__all__`, at every
depth: a name is public here because a list says so, not because it
happens to lack a leading underscore. A list per module is a list per
module to keep true, and the policy tests below are what keeps it, rather
than a reviewer noticing.

These tests are written against the names rather than the counts, so that a
deliberate addition is one line here and an accidental one is a failure.
Each collects what it finds and asserts the collection empty, so that a
failure names every offender at once rather than the first.
