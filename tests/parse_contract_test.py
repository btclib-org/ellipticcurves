"""Tests for the parse contract every `parse` in the package owes its caller.

One file rather than a case per module, because the rule is one and
`src/ellipticcurves/_utils.py` states it: a field is as long as its
encoding says, a complete octet string is one whole object, and a
caller's stream is the caller's. What the tests hold every parser to is
that none of the three depends on `check_validity`, which is an opinion
about what the bytes mean and not about where they end.

The inventory at the top is what those tests run over, and the last test
is what makes it a promise rather than a list: it walks the package for
every public class carrying a `parse` and fails unless each one is either
in the inventory or in a table of exclusions naming its reason. A parser
added to the package and forgotten here would otherwise be held to
nothing.
