"""The gate for what `parse`, `serialize`, `b64decode` and `b64encode` take.

"Every public function validates its inputs", at the boundary where an
object meets octets or text: a value of a type the signature does not
declare leaves as a `BTClibEccTypeError`, a value of a declared
type that no valid input carries as a `BTClibEccValueError`. Issue
btclib-org/btclib#867 is where the family was measured.

**Not the contract `parse_contract_test.py` holds.** That file asks where
the bytes end -- a field is as long as its encoding says, a complete octet
string is one whole object, a caller's stream is the caller's -- and this
one asks what type the argument is. The two are different questions about
the same methods, which is why the walk that finds every one of them is
`tests/__init__.py`'s and neither file's.

**`serialize` and `b64encode` have nothing to drive**: their input is
the object, which `check_validity_test.py` owns. `_EXTRA_ARGUMENTS`
records what else the family takes, and the walk at the end is what
keeps that record honest -- one more added to the family fails there
until it is driven or given a reason.

**Parametric above the byte boundary, mono-format at it.** `ec` and
`hf` are arguments everywhere arithmetic and protocol take them --
`sign`, `verify`, `key_agg` -- and nowhere in this family: no `parse`
or `serialize` here declares either, and
`test_the_family_takes_no_ec_or_hf` is what turns that from an
agreement into a gate (issue btclib-org/btclib#1084). The *object* keeps
its curve regardless -- `ssa.Sig` declares `ec: Curve = secp256k1` as a
field, so a signature on `ec13_11` is built, validated, signed and
verified exactly as one on secp256k1. What it cannot do is round-trip
through a format that curve was never defined over. The encoding does
not name its curve or its hash function, so `parse(data, ec=...)` would
not be parsing -- it would be decoding under instruction, accepting in
silence a caller who names the wrong one and handing back a well-formed
object built from octets that meant something else.

`check_validity` is not driven anywhere in this file: it is a flag that
decides whether a check runs rather than what is computed, so it is read
for its truth, and `check_validity_test.py` owns that convention.
`dsa.Sig.parse`'s `strict` is the same kind of flag and the same
exemption; `bool_parameter_test.py` is where that classification is
decided, for every flag in the package and with the reason for each.
