"""Every module this package ships is documented, and nothing else is.

The pages under `docs/source/` are written by hand, which invites drift,
and re-running `sphinx-apidoc -f` is no answer: it regenerates every page
from its template, discarding the comments and the `:exclude-members:`
a page carries. What drift costs is a module absent from the
automodule directives -- and therefore from the published documentation --
with nothing anywhere to say so; this module is the thing that says so.
