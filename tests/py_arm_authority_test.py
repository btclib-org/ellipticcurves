"""What says the Python arm is right, other than the bindings.

The suite validates this package's Python arithmetic *against*
libsecp256k1, and `tests/curves/curve_test.py` says so in as many words:
"The bindings are the authority on the answer". Agreeing with the
reference implementation is what a second implementation owes, and that
property is worth checking.

A caller running the Python arm precisely so that a libsecp256k1 user is
not checked with libsecp256k1 needs the other property: if the only thing
that ever says the Python arm is right is a comparison with libsecp256k1,
the circle is closed one level up rather than broken
(issue btclib-org/btclib#198). So this file is the inventory
issue btclib-org/btclib#993 asks for: per arm, which vectors of somebody
else's making reach it.

Two things make the inventory possible to keep true rather than to
believe. The arms are counted from the source -- a function containing a
call to `_libsecp256k1_serves` is an arm -- so one added without an entry
here fails. And the entries were measured, not reasoned:

    uv run --locked --no-default-groups --group harness \
        pytest <one module> --cov=ellipticcurves --cov-report=json \
        --cov-fail-under=0

in an environment with no bindings installed, reading back which lines of
each arm ran. A module is named here when its run reached the arm's body,
the `def` line excluded -- that line runs at import and would report
every arm of every imported module as reached.

**Nothing here re-runs the measurement.** The tests below check the
table's shape -- its keys against the parser, its empty entries against
the named set, its cited modules against the vector table, its entries
against that same table -- and none reruns the coverage that produced
`_AUTHORITY`'s values: every module `_THIRD_PARTY_VECTORS` names, under
coverage, in an environment with no bindings, is minutes rather than
seconds, and nothing here asks a contributor's branch to pay for it.

That re-derivation is `.github/workflows/py-arm-authority.yml`, calling
`.github/scripts/check_py_arm_authority.py` weekly and on every push to
`main`. It repeats the measurement above, module by module, and fails on
any of three disagreements: an entry claims a module that no longer
reaches the arm (stale, the harmful direction), a module reaches an arm
its entry does not name (the table understates, still worth knowing), or
something now reaches an arm in `_WITHOUT_AN_AUTHORITY` (the good news
this file is written to notice). A sentinel and not a gate: it has no
branch rule, so on a pull request that is not itself about this file,
the script or the workflow, the table can go stale until the next run.

**The attribution is per module, and a module may also hold tests this
project wrote.** `tests/curves/curve_test.py` is the clearest case: it
reads Core's `pubkey.json` and carries a great deal else. So an entry
says "a module built on third-party vectors reaches this arm", which is
weaker than "this vector reaches this arm" and is what the measurement
supports. Sharpening it means selecting the vector-driven tests within a
module, which no marker in the tree expresses.

`_WITHOUT_AN_AUTHORITY` names the arms no such module reaches, and the
comment above it says what would close each.

#   No vendored vector here hands the package octets to multiply; a set

# - `ecc.dsa.__init__`, `Signer`'s constructor. Every third-party vector
#   reaches `dsa.sign_` or `dsa.assert_as_valid_` through the free
#   functions; pointing one of those modules at the class is a test to
#   write rather than a vector to find.

#   recovery. No vendored vector set recovers a key from an ECDSA
#   signature: the bitcoin message signature is the scheme that does, and

    """Return every Python arm, mapped to where its body runs.

    The definition issue btclib-org/btclib#968 used, applied by the
    parser rather than by hand: a function whose source calls
    `_libsecp256k1_serves` has two arms, and the one this file is about
    is the arm that call declines.
    `_libsecp256k1_serves` itself is the predicate and not an arm.

    Three things about how it counts, each of which errs loudly rather
    than quietly, which is the direction this file needs:

    - the match is textual, over the function's own source. A comment or
      a docstring writing the call spelling invents an arm, and a nested
      function is attributed to its enclosing function as well as to
      itself. Neither can hide a real arm, and a comment naming
      `_libsecp256k1_serves` with no parenthesis after it, the way the
      modules here write one, invents nothing.
    - `AsyncFunctionDef` is walked as well as `FunctionDef`. The tree has
      no async in it; one holding a dispatch would otherwise be invisible
      rather than reported, and invisible is the direction that costs.
    - the key is `module.funcname`, so two same-named methods of two
      classes in one module would collide into one entry and leave one
      arm unexamined. `curves.curve.__init__` and `ecc.ssa.__init__` are
      already that shape, in two modules; a third in either would be the
      case to watch.

    The range is the function's own body -- `node.body[0].lineno` through
    `node.end_lineno`, the `def` line itself excluded on purpose, since it
    runs at import regardless of whether the function is ever called and
    would otherwise report every arm of every imported module as reached.
    `.github/scripts/check_py_arm_authority.py` is what reads this
    range against a coverage run's `executed_lines` to re-derive
    `_AUTHORITY`; `_py_arms()` below reads only the keys.
