"""Tests for the import graph of the `btclib_ecc` package.

Every module must be importable *first*, with no other module of this
package in sys.modules yet. Nothing else in the suite establishes that: a
test module reaches its subject through whatever the modules imported
before it have already pulled in, so a cycle that only bites the caller
who happens to arrive from the other side stays invisible.

What a module may import is the standard library, `typing_extensions`,
the bindings and this package: each module is asked in an interpreter of
its own at run time, and each file's import statements are read
statically, which is what a module the suite never imports is checked
by.
