"""Tests for `btclib_ecc.exceptions`, and for what an exception carries.

The classes with nothing added to their base need no test of their own:
what they are is the base, and every module raising one asserts the
message it raised. What is tested here is the two carrying a field --
`InvalidContributionError` and `BorromeanRingError` -- and specifically
that a field survives leaving the process it was raised in, which is the
case the field exists for and the one nothing else in the suite
exercises: pytest-xdist sends a report as text, so no exception object
crosses between workers.
