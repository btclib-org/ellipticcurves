# Tests and code coverage

## The suite

```shell
uv sync
uv run pytest
```

`--cov` is in `addopts`, so the bare `pytest` is the coverage gate, the
same measurement the `coverage` job makes, and it answers against
`fail_under` in `pyproject.toml`. A run that selects a subset — a path
that leaves part of the suite behind, `-k`, `-m`, `--deselect`,
`--ignore`, `--ignore-glob` or `--lf` — prints the report without the
threshold: `coverage_fail_under` in `tests/conftest.py` is where that
happens, and section 8 of [the organization standard][std] names the
set.

```shell
uv run pytest --no-cov
```

runs the suite without measuring anything.

## Convention tests

Section 7 of [the organization standard][std] lists conventions a suite
can turn into a red test, and a repository needs the ones its own prose
states rather than all of them. So which of them this repository tests
is declared here, in two halves that together account for every one of
them: the table below and the "Not tested here" line under it. One row
per module, so a convention answered by more than one file is named once
per file, and `conventions_test.py` asserts the declaration is true.

| convention | tested in |
| --- | --- |
| the public surface | `all_test.py` |
| the copyright header | `copyright_test.py` |
| the documentation | `docs_test.py` |
| the import graph | `imports_test.py` |
| the changelog | `release_notes_test.py` |
| the calling convention | `keyword_only_test.py` |
| the calling convention | `name_contract_test.py` |
| the calling convention | `private_defaults_test.py` |
| input validation | `input_validation_test.py` |

Not tested here: the build system; the suite opens no socket.

The calling convention takes three modules because it is three rules --
a keyword-only parameter stays keyword-only, a private signature carries
no default, and a public name promises what the call answers -- and
section 7 states it as one bullet.
