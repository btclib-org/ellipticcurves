"""Exception classes.

These exist only to tell an exception raised by ellipticcurves from one
raised by any other code: each derives from the built-in that says what
kind of failure it is, and adds nothing to it.

`EllipticCurvesException` is what makes that telling apart a single
`except` rather than a tuple of three a caller has to keep in step with
this hierarchy. It is inherited *beside* the built-in and not instead of
it, which is the half that matters: `EllipticCurvesValueError` is a
`ValueError`, so code catching the built-in catches it, and
`json.JSONDecodeError` is the standard library doing the same.

It is caught and never raised: every raise below is one of the three,
and which one answers a question the base cannot carry -- whether the
value was wrong, the type was, or neither was and a check failed anyway.
A caller with something to do about that difference names the specific
class; `except EllipticCurvesException` is for the caller who only needs
to know it came from here.

The two classes carrying a field hand every constructor argument to
`BaseException.__init__` and compose their message in `__str__`, which
is what `subprocess.CalledProcessError` and `UnicodeDecodeError` do, and
what makes them picklable: `BaseException.__reduce__` returns `(cls,
self.args)`, so a class whose `args` is the composed message alone is
rebuilt by calling it with one argument, and one argument is not what it
takes. That is a TypeError out of `pickle`, out of `copy.copy` and out
of `copy.deepcopy` -- and out of a `ProcessPoolExecutor`, which cannot
send the exception back and reports a broken pool instead of the failure
the worker died of.
