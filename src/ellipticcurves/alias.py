"""The type aliases of the public API, and the input conventions they name.

Octets and String below are the same union, so mypy cannot tell one
from the other: passing a text string where a hex-string is expected
is a type error this file names but no checker can catch. The distinction
is enforced at run time instead, by the converter each function calls on
its way in -- bytes_from_octets for Octets, str_from_string for String --
and it is documented here because that is the only place it can be read
as one piece.

Making them NewTypes would let mypy separate them, at the cost of every
caller having to wrap its literals: Octets("deadbeef") instead of
"deadbeef", throughout a public API whose whole style is to accept
whatever is convertible. That is a different package, not a fix to this
one.

# What a HashF returns: as much of the hashlib object as this package uses,

# hf().digest_size go unchecked, and with them every expression downstream
# of a hash function -- in a mypy-strict code base a typo in either would
# be a runtime AttributeError.
#
# Not hashlib._Hash, which is what typeshed calls the class: a private
# name, and structural typing is the right tool for "whatever hashlib.new
# returns". typeshed writes this same Protocol beside it, under this very
# class's name, and marks it type_check_only, so importing that one is no
# option either.
#
# An extendable-output function is not one of these, and here is where it
# is refused: hashlib.shake_128 fails this Protocol statically, its
# digest() requiring the output length that digest() -> bytes does not
# declare, and its digest_size reading 0. Not a restriction of this package --
# typeshed derives HASHXOF from HASH through a type: ignore[override], and
# hmac.new rejects an XOF as a digestmod for the same reason, which is
# dsa.sign's answer too: rfc6979 hands hf to hmac.new, and HMAC over an
# XOF is not defined (NIST specifies KMAC instead). An XOF is a function
# of data *and* length, and the length has nowhere to live here, so what
# reads SHAKE vectors is an adapter pinning one, not a wider Protocol
