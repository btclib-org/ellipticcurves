"""The coercions every public function runs its inputs through.

Private: these are the conversions an `Octets`, a `String`, an `Integer`
and a `BinaryData` parameter owe their caller, and the refusals of a
short read and of trailing bytes, raised through this package's own
exceptions.

`read_exactly` and `assert_no_trailing` are the two halves of what every
`parse` owes its caller:

- a field is as long as its encoding says it is, so a short read is an
  error and not a value
- octets are one whole object, so bytes after it are refused; a caller's
  stream is not, so parsing consumes the object and leaves the stream on
  the byte after it
