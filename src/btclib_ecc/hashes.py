    The mistake it catches is `sha256()` written where `sha256` belongs --
    the digest object instead of the class that makes one -- which is a
    caller's own error and not a statement about the message or the
    signature it was passed with.

    `callable` and not a trial call: a digest object is not callable, so
    the check is a slot lookup rather than the hash it would otherwise
    have to build, which matters where it sits in front of a verification
    the bindings answer fast enough for that hash to show.

    So it is not exhaustive, and does not need to be: a callable of the
    wrong shape -- a one-shot digest, which takes the message rather than
    making a digest, the `_one_shot` of `tests/alias_test.py` -- still
    fails at the `hf()` that follows, with the TypeError Python raises for
    the missing argument, which is what that test expects. What matters for
    the verifications is not the class but that neither one is a
    ValueError, so neither is mistaken for a signature that does not
    verify.

    A `BTClibEccTypeError` for the reason the class exists, and with a
    consequence the boolean verifications depend on: it is a `TypeError`,
    so their `except (ValueError, BTClibEccRuntimeError)` does not catch it
    and a caller's mistake reaches the caller instead of being reported as
    a signature that does not verify.
