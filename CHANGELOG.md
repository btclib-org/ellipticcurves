An entry for anything a reader would notice: what changed, and the issue
it answers. That is section 9 of [the organization standard][std], and it
is narrower than "every change" — a comment reworded inside a workflow
changes nothing a reader of this repository meets, and lands without an
entry. [RELEASE_NOTES.md](./RELEASE_NOTES.md) has the release notes,
which say what a user has to act on; this file is the record behind them.

Neither file states how many entries it holds: a stated number is a line
every open branch has to edit, and the two files carry a union merge
driver that would keep both sides' numbers.

## v2026.10 (work in progress, not released yet)

## v2026.9.26

### The repository opens

The package: elliptic curve arithmetic over any short Weierstrass curve,
the signature, commitment and key-agreement schemes built on it, and the
vectors they answer to (issue btclib-org/btclib#2282).

### `REPOSITORY.md` records what each read-back answers

Each read-back carries what it answered on 2026-09-26; classic
protection's also reads its force-push and deletion switches, and the
environments' their required reviewers (issue btclib-org/btclib#2282).

### The distribution is `btclib-ecc`, imported as `btclib_ecc`

Its exceptions are `BTClibEcc*` and its switch `BTCLIB_ECC_NO_LIBSECP256K1`;
the documentation is `btclib-ecc.readthedocs.io` (issue btclib-org/btclib#2282).
