"""Rewrite an sdist's member metadata to this repository's own values.

Every field it rewrites but one already carries the value it writes,
coming out of `uv build --sdist` and measurable with
`tarfile.getmembers()`: `uid` and `gid` are `0`, `uname` and `gname` are
`""`, and the mode is `0o644` for a file and `0o755` for a directory.
`mtime` is the exception -- every member is `0`, and `uv_build` ignores
`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` entirely:

    uv build -o a && SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=1000000000 uv build -o b \
      && shasum -a 256 a/* b/*

answers with one digest per artefact across the two directories. So
rewriting `mtime` is where this step changes the published bytes.
`test.yml`'s `dist` job exports `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` from the commit date
and runs this script over the build, and the archive it hands on carries
a different sha256 from the one `uv build` wrote, on any commit whose
timestamp is not `0`. That archive is what the index serves and what the
attestation vouches for, so this step decides those bytes rather than
standing as insurance over a backend that already writes them.

What running it on the other fields buys is that they stay this
repository's answer whatever a future `uv_build` writes there, the same
reason a release rebuilt from its tag has to give back the bytes the
attestation vouches for however many backends later that is.

What is *in* the archive is already deterministic; only the metadata of
the members is rewritten here, and nothing else: `mtime` becomes
`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`, ownership becomes root with no names, mode becomes
`0o644` for a file and `0o755` for a directory -- nothing in the sdist
needs the executable bit, no source file here opening with a shebang,
which `.pre-commit-config.yaml` records as a decision rather than an
accident -- and the gzip header carries the same timestamp instead of
the moment it was compressed. The order of the members and every byte of
their content are the archive's own.

`PAX_FORMAT` with the extended headers cleared, rather than
`USTAR_FORMAT`: an integral timestamp needs no PAX record, so the two
formats write the same bytes today -- and the day a path in the sdist
outgrows ustar's 100 characters, pax records it and ustar would have
refused it.

Run it after `uv build` and before anything reads dist/:

    uv run --no-project --python 3.15 \
        .github/scripts/normalize_sdist.py dist/

RELEASING.md's "Rebuild a release from its tag" is what that is for: the
command there runs this script over the rebuild, and a rebuild that
skips it answers with the `mtime` `uv_build` wrote rather than the one
the published archive carries.
